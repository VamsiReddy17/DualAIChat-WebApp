# DualAIChat-WebApp
DualChatbots-Azure is a web application that integrates two chatbot models—GPT-4 and DeepSeek—simultaneously. The project uses Azure Static Web Apps for the frontend and Azure Functions for the backend, enabling a single user prompt to be sent concurrently to both AI models. Responses are displayed side by side in a responsive, modern UI.
